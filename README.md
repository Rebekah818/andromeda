# Cosmo Quotes

Welcome to Cosmo Quotes, created by team Andromeda! Cosmo Quotes is a web application that presents the user with NASA's Astronomy Picture of the Day and an inspirational quote to go along with it. The user can then choose to save this to their Album where they can keep all of their pictures and quotes to look back on! Our motivation for Cosmo Quotes is to inspire and encourage people to seize the day.
